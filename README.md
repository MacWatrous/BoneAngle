# BoneAngle
An iOS app for measuring angles on X-Rays.

This app was intended for my uncle to use in the field when on deployment with Doctors Without Borders. He requested an app in which you could superimpose two lines on an image (in his case an X-Ray) and find the angle between them. This app does exactly that.
